keys.betterquesting.desc.000021.name=§r为了进入工业时代，需要更先进的工具。有六种主要类型的工具。\n\n§6§l首先应该制作青铜工具，因为你离铁还有一段距离。§r\n\n§2锤子§r几乎到处都用得到。它用于制作所有其他工具，并将锭变成板\n§2锉刀§r将锭变成棒。\n§2锯§r将木板变成台阶，将原木变成6个木板。\n§2螺丝刀§r用于大多数配方和设置盖子。它还制作重要的零件，如齿轮和转子。\n§2扳手§r用于切割管道，它可能是所有工具中最重要的。\n§2剪线钳§r切割电线。\n\n§l§c§lJEI和书中都会显示铁制工具在工具使用的地方。除铁之外的工具不会出现在JEI搜索中。青铜工具存在并且应该首先制作。通常，配方接受各种类型的工具。§r
keys.betterquesting.desc.000022.name=炉子并不适合熔炼物品。它的最高温度只有1000 K（730°C），这对铁来说还不够热。\n\n原始高炉由32个§c耐火砖§r和1个§4原始高炉控制器§r组成。它是一个§a3x4x3结构§r§r，由耐火砖组成，中间是空的。如需更多帮助，请查看JEI数据库中的§c结构预览§r。\n\n原始高炉可以熔炼铁、锻铁和§b钢§r。它的最高温度约为1400 K（1,127°C）。\n\n与许多其他结构一样，多个原始高炉的墙壁可以共享，它们仍然可以正常工作。
keys.betterquesting.desc.000023.name=§7闪锌矿§r脉含有§7闪锌矿矿石§r，这是锌的重要来源。它在地球上的高度为0到60，但也在地壳的最深部分。\n\n锌是室温下略带脆性的金属，具有闪亮的灰色外观。\n\n锌将用于制造磁铁，但如果你找不到锌，§a磁铁矿矿石§r也可以替代使用。
keys.betterquesting.desc.000024.name=要制造磁铁，你必须有一个§b伏打电堆§r。§c\n§r\n伏打电堆由三个组件组成：一个§6铜板§r，一个§7锌板§r和电解纸。\n\n常见的电解质是§6柠檬酸§r。用柠檬、酸橙或橙子和纸一起会制作出电解纸。酸橙可以在丛林中找到，柠檬可以在丛林边缘和森林中找到，而橙子可以在热带草原生物中找到。\n\n如果你拿不到伏打电堆，你可以使用另一种方法来磁化铁棒，使用§6磁铁矿§r。
keys.betterquesting.desc.000025.name=§7铁§r是地球上最常见的元素。它用于提炼成§6钢§r[见下一页]和基础工具。它是工业时代最重要的金属之一。\n\n从铁矿石中提取可用的金属需要窑炉或炉子（如§c高炉§r），能够达到1500°C（1,773K）或更高的温度，比熔炼铜所需的温度高出约500°C。
keys.betterquesting.desc.000026.name=首先，你需要一个§c铁棒§r - 将铁锭制成棒（用锉刀），然后将其放入炉子。\n\n有两种制作磁铁的方法：\n\n- 将热铁棒与§c磁铁矿块§r放在工作台中，\n- 或使用§c伏打电堆§r和一些§c铜细线§r（你需要特殊设备）。\n\n这个过程只做一次§r。新形成的§c磁性铁棒§r可以用来磁化其他热铁棒，所以不要扔掉它！\n\n§3这将解锁工业时代。
keys.betterquesting.desc.000027.name=§7磁铁矿§r矿石可以在工作台中分解成§7磁铁矿块§r。它们可以用来磁化§6铁棒§r。
keys.betterquesting.desc.000028.name=我们可以用§6青铜§r制作更好的工具。你需要先制作工具零件，然后组装工具。\n\n青铜斧可以一次性砍倒整棵树。\n\n青铜采矿锤可以一次性挖掘整个3x3米的区域，除非你按住§aSHIFT§r。\n\n青铜铲与采矿锤的作用相同，但它适用于与铲子相关的块，如泥土和沙子。\n\n§c§lJEI和书中都会显示铁制工具在工具使用的地方。除铁之外的工具不会出现在JEI搜索中。青铜工具存在并且应该首先制作。通常，配方接受各种类型的工具。§r

keys.betterquesting.desc.000783.name=Solar power is one of the simplest power generation methods, simply place down a solar panel that has a clear view of the sky. Will not work at night or when it is raining, so it's best to add a battery buffer to it. The main downside is very low yield.
